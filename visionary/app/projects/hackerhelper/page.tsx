              to build the interactive prototype for the desktop and mobile
              layouts of HackerHelper on Figma. To enforce consistency and
              improve my efficiency for prototyping, I built a library of
              reusable UI components (buttons, forms, inputs, etc.) in Figma
              that can be adapted for both desktop and mobile, complete with
              established typography styles, colors, and spacing values.

              Mentors also struggle with identifying whether or not a hacker’s

              Hackers, especially beginners, often find it difficult to

              which results in misunderstandings and delays in receiving
              effective help from mentors. This complicates mentors' ability to

            <p>
              This increases the chances of hacker messages being
              unintentionally missed, ignored, or forgotten. Some mentors are
              also hesitant to communicate their inability to solve a problem
              because they are scared of seeming incompetent, which causes
              further delays for hackers hoping to receive guidance.

              Hackers expressed that mentors who actively help and regularly
              check-in lead to a more positive hackathon experience. However,
              without a feedback system for mentors, when hackers receive
              inadequate support and mentorship, they cannot provide input to
              help mentors improve their skills. This is detrimental, as poor
              mentorship can deter hackers from participating in future

            HackerHelper recognizes that Marley has CSS experience and

            As a previous hacker and mentor, I think an app like HackerHelper
            would be really useful! It makes it much easier for hackers to
            connect with mentors, and for mentors to communicate with each
            other. This would be especially helpful in larger hackathons by
            keeping requests organized and clearly indicating which request is
            being worked on by which mentor. So overall, I would love to see
            this implemented for future hackathons."

              deep insights into the discovery stage of the design process. Here
              are some key findings that I encountered during the process:

              For instance, it doesn’t allow user input, making it harder to
